# python-challenge
this project will demonstrate efficiency in converting data using Python

This project disects data from two separate datasets: PyBank and PyPoll. It will display data ranging from Profit/Losses to the winner of an election (depending on which set you are looking at). 

PyBank:
PyBank is a financial analysis of the given dataset. After being ran, it will display the header ("Financial Analysis"), the total months, total profit, average change, and the greatest increase/decrease in profits. 

PyPoll: 
PyPoll is a collection of election results from a local poll. After being ran, this dataset will display the header ("Election Results"), the total number of votes cast, as well as the total percentage/total number of votes each individual candidate received. Finally, the code will display the winner of the election. 

Challenges Faced: I was once again struck with the challenge of indentation and making sure all codes are "lined up" properly under the loops. I am starting to get the hang of Python and appreciate that the interface allows you to see exactly where the error is - it makes for a much quicker debugging!
